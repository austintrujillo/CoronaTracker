# Covid-19 - Thermal Printer Tracker

I have designed this project to scrape daily information about current Covid-19 metrics from the Utah Department of Health website. It then prints out a report based on changes and currently reported cases.

I am using a modified thermal printer that directly integrates a Raspberry Pi Zero W which draws power directly from the printers power supply.

This applet is ran as a service on the Pi along with [IPAWS](https://github.com/austintrujillo/IPAWS).
